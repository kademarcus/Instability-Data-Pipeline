## Global Political Instability Dataset Project

## Project Overview

This project builds a comprehensive dataset describing **global political instability** using data pulled from multiple reputable sources:

- **UCDP (Uppsala Conflict Data Program)** – conflict and violence data  
- **World Bank** – economic and governance indicators (and an actual instability variable useful for statistical models) 
- **Fragile States Index** – institutional fragility and social pressures

The dataset will combine variables such as:
- Armed conflict, fatalities, and intensity  
- Political stability and governance scores  
- GDP per capita, population, and education spending  
- Fragility metrics  
- (More to come)

The cleaned and merged dataset will be:
- Stored in a **SQL data warehouse**  
- Used for **Power BI dashboards** and exploratory analysis  
- Ready for use in forecasting and political risk models
